roaming-initiative-http
=======================

The front-facing site interface for roaming-initiative.com, not including the blog.

While this is intended to be useful as a "head start" for making similar sites,
it must primarily service its actual use on the author's Linode-hosted site at
http://roaming-initiative.com/, so while I'll happily merge in changes that
make this run on a wider range of system configurations, I'll only be developing
and testing with Debian Stable, and writing for my own needs.

DEPENDENCIES
============

 * nginx >= 1.2.5 (stable via nginx.org)
 * Python >= 2.6
 * uwsgi 1.4.1
