<h1> Hardware </h1>
<p>We're going to have a couple different types of hardware we buy and sell as official parts of this project. The important thing to remember, though, is that we're just one vendor of open-standards-using hardware, and all this stuff is perfectly interoperable with existing CJDNS networks right out of the box.</p>

    <div class="title">The RITower</div>
    <p>A long-range wireless backbone hub. Supports both WiFi <em>and WiMax</em> communication. This means it's a compatible access point for smaller mesh devices within WiFi range, but it can also talk to other WiMax towers over a much larger range at high bandwidth. Comes with battery pack for up to 8 hours of uninterrupted communication in the event of power grid failure. Perfectly capable of talking to WiMax-compatible small devices.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that WiMax uses different frequencies than WiFi, and requires extra licensing from the FCC to use. We're going to obtain our own license for setting up neighborhood backbones using this hardware, but if you buy one from us for your own use, you'll need your own FCC license. Comparable laws are probably present in other countries, so be sure to do your own research of local WiMax regulation.</p>
